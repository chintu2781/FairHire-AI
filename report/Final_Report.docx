TITLE: FairHire AI – Intelligent Resume Ranking and Bias Detection System

ABSTRACT:
This project introduces an AI-powered hiring assistant that ranks resumes,
matches them with job descriptions using deep learning, and detects potential
gender, age, or university bias. By leveraging SBERT transformers, NLP parsing,
and explainability tools (LIME/SHAP), the system produces fair and transparent
candidate scoring. The project contributes to ethical AI solutions in HR tech.
